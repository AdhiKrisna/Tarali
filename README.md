## 🧠 Motivation & Purpose
Tarali was developed as a **thesis project** for our client pursuing a Master's degree in education. The goal was to create a **culturally-relevant**, feature-rich mobile application that not only promotes **literacy and storytelling** skills among children, but also preserves **Balinese heritage** in an accessible digital form.
